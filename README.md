Key Insights:

Technology (especially Copiers and Phones) is the most profitable category.

Tables and Bookcases are consistently loss-making and need reevaluation.

The West and East regions lead in sales and profitability.

Higher discounts correlate negatively with profit, indicating potential over-discounting.
